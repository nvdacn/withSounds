# WithSounds for NVDA

**Enhance your NVDA experience with earcons!**

## Overview

WithSounds is a simple NVDA add-on designed to enhance your browsing and computer interaction by replacing certain spoken feedback with intuitive earcons (short, distinctive sounds). Currently, WithSounds focuses on providing auditory cues for web links, aiming for a less verbose and more efficient experience.

## Features

* **Link Role Earcon Replacement:** Replaces NVDA's default spoken feedback for elements with the "link" role in browse mode with a distinct earcon. Instead of hearing "link" spoken aloud, you will now hear a short, pleasant sound to indicate a link. This can significantly reduce speech clutter, especially on web pages with numerous links.
* **Visited Link State Suppression:**  WithSounds also suppresses NVDA's announcement of the "visited" state for links. This provides a cleaner and less repetitive browsing experience, particularly if you find the "visited" state announcement redundant.

## Important Notes

1. **Simplified Functionality:** This is a very basic add-on.  Tony's [Earcons and speech rules](https://github.com/mltony/nvda-phonetic-punctuation/) add-on provides similar functionality, but with more extensive features and configuration options.  WithSounds can be seen as a simplified alternative focusing specifically on link earcons and visited state suppression.
2. **Avoid Conflicts:**  It is recommended that you **do not install WithSounds alongside Tony's "Earcons and speech rules" add-on**.  Installing both may lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts in how earcons and speech rules are applied.

## Future Considerations

* **Container Earcons:** Future development may explore using earcons to indicate entering and exiting containers (e.g., tables, lists) to further enhance auditory navigation.
